# radiant-rs
Thread-safe Rust sprite rendering engine with an easy to use API and custom shader support.

This is work-in-progress. The API is incomplete and will likely still change somewhat. Have a look if you like, but don't depend on it :)

[Getting started and reference here](https://sinesc.github.io/doc/radiant_rs/).

To compile the examples, use e.g. `cargo run --release --example blobs`. See examples folder for other available examples.
